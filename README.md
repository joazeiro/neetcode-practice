# NeetCode Practice

<a href="https://neetcode.io/practice">NeetCode</a> is a website where you can practice the most common questions that appear on Software Development interviews. My objective throughout the Summer of 2023 is going to be completing all of those and its follow up challenges, such as answer the question with a better runtime or utilizing a specific approach.</br></br>
The questions will be separated into folders that correspond to the topics in the NeetCode website and they are all going to be solved in Python <strong>(unless I feel like I want to do some Java on that day)</strong>. Also, each question's file will contain the full description of the question, examples, and constrains, along with the solution and (maybe) the runtime of my solution.</br></br>
My objective is to do at least 2 questions a day or 14 a week, which would make me complete all 150 question in approximately 11 weeks.
